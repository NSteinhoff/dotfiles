usage: tcr-sync

Sync up with the remote-tracking branch when a test && commit || revert
cycle finished. This allows for simultaneous work by multiple developers
on the same branch, or even the same file.

It will rebase onto the changes that have occurred remotely
and push the result.

In case that a CI build is configured, it will be skipped to avoid running
a build every few seconds.

    -h, --help      Show this help.
