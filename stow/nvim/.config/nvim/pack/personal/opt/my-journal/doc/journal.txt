journal.txt                                                      *journal.txt*

Plugin for taking notes and keeping a journal while you are coding.


==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION                                                         *journal*
                                                        *journal-introduction*

The goal of this plugin is to provide easy access to a place to put random
thoughts as well as more structured notes. It should be as non-intrusive as
possible, so as not to interrupt or disturb the main task.


Design Philosophy~

Use standard Vim features as much as possible. That means no fancy custom UI,
using `quickfix` and `location` lists. Do not require the user to lear


Roadmap~

*   A useful 'keywordprg', maybe based on `:Apropos`
*   Navigate via tags (window local 'tags' config?)
*   Load hierarchical table of contents into the location list.
    Similar to the `gO` outline mapping in Nvim's help.

USAGE                                                          *journal-usage*

                                                 *:Journal* *journal-:Journal*
:Journal

    Open the journal file and create a new entry with the current datetime as
    a header.

                                                     *:About* *journal-:About*
:About [topic]

    Edit/create a markdown file about the specified [topic].
    When [topic] is not provided, edit the top level notes directory.

    The [topic] can include path separators `some/interesting/topic`.
    Intermediate directories will be created as necessary.


                                                 *:Apropos* *journal-:Apropos*
:Apropos [regex]

    Search all notes for [regex] using an external grep commands. If `ripgrep`
    is installed, it is preferred over `grep`. Opens a split with the first
    result and populates the location list.


==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                          *journal-configuration*

                                                          *g:journal_root_dir*
g:journal_root_dir = get(environ(), 'JOURNAL_ROOT', '~/journal')

    The root directory of the journal files. New entries will be created under
    this directory. Searches will be restricted to this directory.

                                                          *g:journal_filename*
g:journal_filename = 'journal.md'

    The name of the journal file inside the `g:journal_root_dir` opened by
    the `:Journal` command.
